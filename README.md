# msd-backgroundlogger
A dummy malware app that will log motion sensor data in background and send it to [msd-server](https://github.com/nyrrrr/msd-server) for further analysis.

[msd-backgroundlogger](https://github.com/nyrrrr/msd-backgroundlogger/), [msd-collector](https://github.com/nyrrrr/msd-collector/), [msd-server](https://github.com/nyrrrr/msd-server/) and [data-thesis](https://github.com/nyrrrr/data-thesis/) were created for and during my Master's thesis:
_Inferring Passwords from Motion Data on Mobile Devices_
